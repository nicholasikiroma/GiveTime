# Project Title: GiveTime
---
## Project Description:
GiveTime is a web-based platform that aims to connect volunteers with non-profit organizations and help them find volunteering opportunities that match their interests, skills, and availability. The platform is designed to solve the problem of a lack of centralized and easily accessible information about volunteering opportunities, which often leads to a mismatch between volunteers and non-profit organizations.

By providing a platform where volunteers can easily search and find volunteering opportunities that match their preferences, GiveTime hopes to increase the number of volunteers and improve the efficiency of volunteer recruitment and management for non-profit organizations. The platform can also help to build a community of volunteers and non-profit organizations that share a common goal of making a positive impact in their local communities.

GiveTime's key features include a search engine that allows volunteers to search for volunteering opportunities based on various criteria such as location, skills required, and cause area. Non-profit organizations can also create profiles on the platform and advertise their opportunities, manage volunteers, and track their impact.

## MVPs for GiveTime:

The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for a volunteer opportunity platform with an admin login for non-profit organizations would include the following features:

- **Volunteer registration:** Volunteers should be able to create a profile and register on the platform, providing basic information about their skills, interests, and availability.

- **Non-profit registration:** Non-profit organizations should be able to register on the platform and create a profile, providing information about their organization, their mission, and the volunteer opportunities they offer.

- **Volunteer opportunity search:** Volunteers should be able to search for volunteer opportunities based on location, keyword, category, and other relevant criteria.

- **Volunteer opportunity details:** Each volunteer opportunity should have a detailed description, including information about the organization, the tasks involved, the time commitment, and any other relevant details.

- **Volunteer application:** Volunteers should be able to apply for volunteer opportunities directly through the platform, and non-profit organizations should be able to review and accept or reject applications.

- **Non-profit dashboard:** Non-profit organizations should have access to a dashboard that allows them to manage their volunteer opportunities, view and accept volunteer applications, and track volunteer hours and impact.

- **Volunteer dashboard:** Volunteers should have access to a dashboard that allows them to manage their profile, view their volunteer history and progress, and communicate with non-profit organizations.

These core features will provide a solid foundation for your volunteer opportunity platform, allowing volunteers and non-profit organizations to connect and engage with one another effectively. As you continue to develop and refine your platform, you can add additional features and functionality based on user feedback and business needs.
